In order to create a function that finds the largest number in two arrays
I had to create a function that find the largest element in one array
I did this implementing the devide and conquer method
The implementation is as Follows

        The find max int function uses recursion to divide the array into sub arrays
        the array is divided up into arrays of length less than 3
        once arrays are devided up then the checks return either a compared max value or a single integer
        the math.max then compares the largest of each sub array

Once I completed the function for finding a max in in one array
I then created a function that takes in two arrays and calls the devided and conquer maxInt function on each
The results of both are then compared and the largest n'th element is printed
